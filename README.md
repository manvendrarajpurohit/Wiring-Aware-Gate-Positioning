# Wiring-Aware-Gate-Positioning
This assignment focuses on wiring-aware gate positioning, aiming to place rectangular logic gates on a 2D plane. Each gate has pins on its boundaries, and the objective is to minimize the total wire length, measured using the Manhattan distance between connected pins. The problem is solved using simulated annealing, an optimization technique that iteratively reduces wire length to achieve near-optimal gate placement.
